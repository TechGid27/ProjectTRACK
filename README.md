## Executive Summary (2-Minute Read)

Every fiscal year, billions of Philippine Pesos are allocated for Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) civil works projects across the country. Citizens, watchdog organizations, journalists, and local governments routinely encounter structural transparency barriers:

* **Opaque Project Statuses**: Difficulty in independently verifying execution progress and tracking completion timelines.
* **Information Fragmentation**: Procurement notices, allocation records, and contractor track records reside in separate, non-relational databases.
* **Absence of Ground-Truth Validation**: Vulnerability to off-site photo submissions and lack of mandatory physical proximity checks during on-site documentation.

**ProjectTrack** addresses these systemic challenges for the Province of Cebu across all **53 Local Government Units (LGUs)** (44 municipalities and 9 cities). By combining automated web scraping, Neo4j knowledge graphs, tamper-evident image forensics, geofenced mobile verification, and a domain-guarded GraphRAG assistant, ProjectTrack converts raw public disclosures into structured, accessible civic intelligence.

## System Features

### Web Platform (`Website`)
* **Interactive Cebu Geospatial Map**: Renders vector boundaries for all 53 LGUs down to barangay levels without relying on heavy satellite tile streaming, displaying status-coded markers. Overlapping projects are grouped by zoom-aware proximity clustering, and the map stays synchronized with the chat - flying to a selected LGU or zooming to and highlighting a single project for superlative/locating questions.
* **GraphRAG-Powered AI Assistant**: Contextual natural language query engine grounded in the Neo4j knowledge graph, with domain guardrails and a configurable LLM provider (Groq by default). Supports conversational memory for follow-ups ("tell me more about it", "what about in Cordova?") via a sandboxed, whitelist-validated reference resolver that stays strictly database-locked and injection-safe. User input and conversation history are sanitized and screened for prompt-injection before reaching the model.
* **Image Forensics Verification**: Citizen-submitted photo evidence is screened server-side with Error Level Analysis (ELA) and perceptual hashing (pHash) to detect digital manipulation or image recycling; flagged reports surface a "Photo Flagged" badge in the UI.
* **Citizen Anomaly Reports with Verification Badging**: The report modal captures browser GPS at submission time; the backend runs a Haversine geofence check against official project coordinates and the UI renders a "On-Site Verified" / "Unverified" / "Photo Flagged" badge with distance and timestamp for every community report.
* **Budget and Expenditure Transparency**: Real-time auditing of allocated funds, expenditure disbursements, variance indicators, and source funding across municipalities.
* **Automated Data Aggregation**: Continuous extraction and normalization of DPWH civil works registries and PhilGEPS procurement bulletins into a unified data store.

### Mobile Field Auditor (`mobile` — React Native with Expo)
* **Geofenced On-Site Photo Capture**: Uses React Native and Expo (`expo-location`, `expo-camera`) to confirm the device is within ≤150m of the project's DPWH coordinates before the live camera shutter unlocks (gallery uploads disabled for ground-truth integrity).
* **Server-Verified Submission & Badging**: Captured audits are submitted to `/api/reports`, re-validated server-side (geofence + image forensics), and the returned verdict — status, distance, forensics result, reputation — is shown on-device.
* **Offline-First Background Sync**: Audits captured offline are queued in a local outbox and synced to the backend when connectivity returns.

### Core Backend and Services (`backend`)
* **Personnel and Entity Graph Mapping**: Models relationships between contractors, authorized managing officers, district engineers, and procurement awards into a traversable graph.
* **Spatial Data Integrity**: Exact, canonicalized municipality matching eliminates cross-LGU leakage, and a polygon reverse-geocoding pipeline reassigns each project to the LGU that actually contains its authentic DPWH coordinates (projects outside Cebu are flagged and excluded).
* **Supabase Authentication**: Backend-managed Supabase (GoTrue) auth under `/api/auth` (OAuth, email/password, session, sign-out) with HTTP-only session cookies, auto token refresh, and a reusable route-guard dependency - ready for the web and mobile clients to hook into.
* **High-Throughput RESTful and SSE API**: Production-grade FastAPI endpoints supporting sub-20ms instant Cypher queries, Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming, and standardized GeoJSON feeds.
* **Field Report Verification API**: `/api/reports` endpoints enforce the four verification pillars server-side — a ≤150m geofence check against authentic DPWH coordinates, ELA + perceptual-hash image forensics, authenticated submission with a 3-reports/day limit and reputation scoring, and a verification verdict (status, distance, forensics, reputation) surfaced to both clients. Reports persist to Supabase Postgres + Storage with a lightweight Neo4j `:Report` node.
